## Thoughts and Considerations:

- Considered a few different approaches for CTR, Pageviews, and Event storage. Local, Session, and Cookies, but in the end decided local was going to be the most straightforward
- CTR threw me off quite a bit at first and it took me a while to work out. I'm still not happy with it and I'd redo that implementation with some input from a senior.
- The current set up is limited in the amount of data actually gathered and sent. I'd expand on that and clean up the data structure being sent. Also I definitely would have preferred to set up a minimal backend, and may still.
- The challenge was a fun one and left a lot of room for interpretation. Given more time I'd clean up the structure and styling drastically, flesh out the error handling quite a bit more, and maybe get larger/more complex data to work with. I also think the types could be cleaned up and improved.
